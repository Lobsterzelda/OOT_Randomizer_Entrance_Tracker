# OOT_Randomizer_Entrance_Tracker

This is an OOT Entrance Randomizer tracker that I've spent the last month working on. I am proud to announce that I have completed the development of version 1.0 of this tracker! Now all features are implemented, and this program can be used by OOT Randomizer enthusiasts (which should no doubt make their lives much easier).

To run this app, you must have python installed and tkinter installed. Note that if you are running this program on a Mac, then you also need to install tkmacosx (otherwise, the graphics will be really messed up and distorted).

entrance_randomizer_start.py is the python script that you need to run to start the application.

So far, all code in this project has been written by me (Lobsterzelda). However, I am open to help from any other programmers who would like to add new features (like item tracking) to this randomizer tracker!
